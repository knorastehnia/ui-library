# Overview

<P>
@kaynora/ui is a high-level, pre-styled component library that is designed with 
full ownership of the UI in mind.
</P>

<P>
While the main focus of the library is to 
provide layers of abstraction over complex component logic and accessibility, 
multiple style-focused components are included to enforce consistency in design.
</P>

## Control when you need it
<P>
As a general rule, component behaviour is uncontrolled by default, and in the case of data-driven 
components, native semantic tags are built in to the components for out-of-the-box integration with 
forms. For more complex use cases, uncontrolled behaviour can easily be switched out for 
controlled state.
</P>

## Accessible by default
<P>
The library handles focus management including focus trapping, focus restoration, and more; as well as 
complete keyboard navigation in accordance with accessibility standards and common practices.
Role and aria-* attributes are set where appropriate, and special APIs are provided for 
extending AT-accessible descriptions where necessary.
</P>

## Less bloat, more elegance
<P>
Great care was taken to design a consistent, intuitive component API that allows for 
rapid development, while escape hatches are provided when fine-grained control is needed.
